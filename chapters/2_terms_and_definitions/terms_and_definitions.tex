\section{How Websites are being loaded}

% [Introduction]
- Brief technical introduction
- It is important to understand how things work, because Metrics and also how to measure them are derived from those processes


% [3 Entities: FE, BE, Network]
It is possible to divide the website loading process into three entities which play a role.
In his code talk 2016, Witt identifies three main areas or bottlenecks where bad performance is being produced: In the Frontend, the Backend, and on the network layer.  % cite 2016 Witt or just say this ??
The Front End is everyhting the user sees on the screen, client, UI, browser, sends requests to a back end, etc.
The Back End is the logic, servier, also data base, handles requests and sends responses to a front end
Network is what connects clients and servers, FE and BE, infrastructure element composed of routers, cables, wireless connections etc.


- BE is not discussed (server time, data base, etc.)
- Section X is about Network
- Section X is about Front end: how browser works, crp, 
- How to optimise websites is not part of this thesis



% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


\subsection{The Network Realm}

Starting from hardware, ISP, routers, switches etc and the cables connecting them is part of the network.
But also communication protocols such as the Internet protocol suite.

Regarding performance, latency and bandwidth come into mind, and we will see that latency has a bigger impact on performance than bandwidth in section X.

After discussing this issue, i will continue by describing the process or navigation steps which happen once the user enters a URL into the browser, up until he sees pixels on his screen and can use the website.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


\subsubsection{Latency vs Bandwidth}

There are two important attributes when discussing network performance: Latency and Bandwidth.
The important thing to say here is that Latency is bottleneck for performance, and not bandwidth.


% [Bandwidth]

Bandwidth is the "maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path". %cite 2013 Grigorik
In other words, bandwidth describes the amount of data which can be sent in parallel from one node in a network to another. 

Physical communication paths are most likely cables such as metal wires or fiber-optic cables, where fiber-optic cables have less signal loss, and lower lifetime maintenance costs.
With methods such as wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), it is possible to transmit up to 70 Tbit/s over a fiber-optic connection.  %cite 2013 Grigorik

This high technology stuff is only used in the backbone infrastructure, e.g. for connecting Europe with America.
For the end user, bandwidth is much lower, and the average was in late 2015 just 5.1 Mbps %cite 2013 Grigorik

A high bandwidth is useful for bulk or large data transfer such as streaming of video or audio.
But for loading a website,or any browser activity that depends on many requests that fetch data from many different locations around the globe, the performance bottleneck is latency. % cite 2013 Grigorik


% [Latency]

Latency is "the time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it".  % cite 2013 Grigorik

Latency is measured in seconds and can be the time spent for one-way, or more common, how long it takes for the transmitted data package for the round-trip time (RTT), from source to destination and back.
In other words, latency "describes the amount of delay on a network or Internet connection". % cite https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Understanding_latency

For the very first request when establishing a connection, latency is longer due to DNS lookup, TCP and TLS handshakes.
Those will be discussed in section X. % cite https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Understanding_latency


% [Experiment]

To get an idea about how the two aspects, bandwidth and latency, impact web performance,  Mike Belshe launched a study. % cite https://docs.google.com/a/chromium.org/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y2hyb21pdW0ub3JnfGRldnxneDoxMzcyOWI1N2I4YzI3NzE2
Once setup has a fixed latency and bandwidth is variable, and vice versa.
He and compared the performance of the two experiments using the Page Load Time metric. (cf. X for this metric)


\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{latency.png}
\caption{Latency vs Bandwidth}
\label{img:latency}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


We can see that the impact of bandwidth is trivial: if the available bandwidth is doubled, e.g. from 5 to 10 Mbps, there is no change in performance load time.
For Latency on the other hand, the picture is different: If the latency can be decreased by half, e.g. from 120 ms to 60 ms, the page load time also sinkt um die h√§lfte.

Or as Belshe states it, "[reducing] cross-atlantic RTTs from 150ms to 100ms [...] would have a larger effect on the speed of the internet than increasing a user's bandwidth from 3.9Mbps to 10Mbps or even 1Gbps." % cite https://docs.google.com/a/chromium.org/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y2hyb21pdW0ub3JnfGRldnxneDoxMzcyOWI1N2I4YzI3NzE2

This obersvations can be explained with the many short, small connections and requests are made when browsing websites and the contrary underlying structure of the communication protocols, which are "optimized for long-lived connections and bulk data transfers. " %cite 2013 Grigorik ch 10

But just simply decreasing the latency is not straightforward: The speed of data transfer is already at a 2/3 of light, but the physical constraint is the limiting factor, e.g. there is a minimum distance between London and New York which can not be optimized. % cite 2013 Grigorik Ch 1


% [Other Aspects]

Another aspect of latency is that for wireless connections and therefore mobile devices, latency is even higher, "making networking optimization a critical priority for the mobile web." % cite 2013 Grigork Ch 1

This is due to the infrastructure of mobile nets, latency is high for mobile users. cf.  Why are mobile latencies so high? in Grigorik % cite https://www.igvita.com/slides/2013/fluent-perfcourse.pdf


As latency is a important factor, what happens on the front end is still important.
And again for this thesis metrics measuring performance in the front end are the focus.

Before i will discuss what happens in the browser once the website data arrived, i will briefly describe the preceding steps of establishing a connection between the browser (client) and the server.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



\subsubsection{Navigation Process}

I will explain briefly the general navigation process: It begins when the user is submitting a URL in the browser and ends when he received website data.

The main steps can be divided into networking, that is, establishing a connection with DNS etc., backend processing, e.g. data base queries etc., and the rendering in the front end, as seen in image X.
The last part of this process is when browser receives finally the HTML / Document. 
How the browser transfers the HTML into an interactive website is part of the next section.


"To start, it is important to recognize that every HTTP request is composed of a number of separate stages (Figure 10-3): DNS resolution, TCP connection handshake, TLS negotiation (if required), dispatch of the HTTP request, followed by content download." % cite Grigorik 2013

% [Connection vs Request]

Explain here difference between Connection and Request.

% 2014 Hogan https://designingforperformance.com/
Chapter 2 The Basics of Page Speed - How Browsers Render Content:
- Connections:
- Number of connections is not the same as number of requests it takes to load the page
- Persistent Connection: Browser keeps connection open for multiple requests
- Parellell possible open connections, 6 for Chrome
- To each domain one connection ??


% Understanding Latency https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Understanding_latency
Network Timings:
- Blocked: When a request is in queue
- Blocking happens when there are too many simultaneous connections to single server over HTTP



% ----------------------------------


% [DNS]
\paragraph{DNS Lookup}

When the requested resource can not be loaded from the browsers cache, the first step to establish a connection is a DNS Lookup (or DNS Resolution).

This step is about translate URL to IP address.
Must be done for each unknown URL, e.g. when linked images within a website are from different server, for each unique URL DNS Lookup has to be done.
The mapping of URL to IP can be cached by browser, which makes repeated views faster. % cite https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work

Avg. time is 20 and 120 ms % https://www.keycdn.com/support/reduce-dns-lookups
Can be considered a performance metric, see section X.


% ----------------------------------


% [TCP]
\paragraph{TCP Handshake}

Once a connection between a client and a server is established, the TCP 3-way-Handshake comes into play.

The goal of TCP is to establish a reliable connection within an unreliable network.
TCP  "guaranteed that all bytes sent will be identical with bytes received and that they will arrive in the same order to the client. " %cite 2013 Grigorik
Regarding performance, the handshake adds two more round trips, which is bad for performance as we have seen because of latency.

Many algorithms and techniques to get optimal data transfer and also avoid congestion are existing, such as Slow-Start.
Slow-Start is an algorithm that determines the maximum bandwidth that can be used by gradually increasing the amount of data sent.
Slow start prevents that the full capacity of the network is being used from the beginning, which in performance terms adds again more round trips and latency. %cite 2013 Grigorik


%TODO
A performance metric reflecting the time spent for establishing a TCP connection is X, see section X.

For a detailed discussion cf "Building Blocks of TCP" in 2013 Grigorik % cite https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-tcp/



% ----------------------------------


% [TLS]
\paragraph{TLS}

TLS is another protocol which has the goal to establish a secure connection in terms of data encryption.
Data transmitted over the network has to be encrypted so that aussenstehende can not read or manipulate the data.
For encryption,  a cipher to be used needs to be established, which will be shared between client and server during the TLS Negotiation. % cite https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work

TLS again adds more round trips which is bad for performance.

%TODO
A performance metric reflecting the time spent for a TLS negotiating is blabla in section X.

for a detailed discussion see Transport Layer Security (TLS) in 2013 Grigorik % https://hpbn.co/transport-layer-security-tls/

% [HTTP Request and Response]
\paragraph{HTTP Request and Response}

% How Browsers Work https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work

\subsection{Front End: Critical Rendering Path}

- This section explains what happens on the Front End, that is in the browser

- Critical Rendering Path: How the Browser works, what exactly happens with the received html etc.
- How Browser works, CRP: First byte, style, layout etc.
- External Resources


The CRP is the last part of the whole process.
In happens in the browser once it received the data / document / HTML

There are a sequence of steps the browser goes through to render the page.

Basic idea:  Convert HTML, CSS and JS to actual pixels on the screen


% How Browsers Work https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work
Parsing:
- Starts when browser received fist data
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have to be parsed.
- Parsing is the step the browser takes to turn the data it receives over the network into the DOM and CSSOM, which is used by the renderer to paint a page to the screen.




% [Single Thread]

% How Browsers Work https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work
- This is somewhat the bottleneck or the technical state of the browser
- Browser is single threaded
- Still: Enable smooth interaction: scrolling, responsive to touch, etc.
- Render time is key
- Goal: Main thread can complete all the work and still is available to handle user interaction
-> Improvement: Understand single thread concept of browser and minimize main threads responsibilities
-> Should lead to: rendering is fast and smooth and responses to interactions are immediate



% [CRP Steps]

The CRP consists of multiple steps.
Once the HTML is received, the browser will parse it to the DOM.
The HTML references CSS and JS files.

CSS will be parsed to CSSOM.

JS needs also to be executed.

Render Tree: Once DOM and CSSOM are available, the Render Tree is being created.

Layout: When the Render Tree is available, Layout is happening.

Paint: Finally, pixels can be printed on the screen.

The individual steps are discussed below.




% ------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{From HTML to DOM}


% [DOM]


- DOM:
	- Converting HTML to DOM:
		- Defined in HTML specification
		- Characters -> Tokens -> Nodes -> DOM

	- Tokenizer:
		- <html><head><meta name="viewport">
		-> Tokens: [StartTag: HTML], [StartTag: head], [Tag: meta], [EndTag: head], ...

	- Convert tokens to node objects:
		-> DOM:
			- Tree structure
			- Objects also contain properties

		- Created incrementally
		-> Beneficial for performance
		- Return partial HTML


% https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/constructing-the-object-model
- Bytes -> characters -> tokens -> nodes -> object model.
- HTML markup is transformed into a Document Object Model (DOM)
- The DOM tree captures the properties and relationships of the document markup, but it doesn't tell us how the element will look when rendered. That‚Äôs the responsibility of the CSSOM.

% https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path
- DOM


% https://medium.com/@luisvieira_gmr/understanding-the-critical-rendering-path-rendering-pages-in-1-second-735c6e45b47a
- DOM




% How Browsers Work https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work
- DOM: internal representation of the markup for the browser
- DOM is also exposed, and can be manipulated through various APIs in JavaScript
- Browser will begin parsing as soon as data received: Important to include most important stuff in first 14Kb

1. Building the DOM tree:
- Build DOM tree by processing HTML markup (tokenization, tree construction)
- Browser requests non-blocking resources and continues parsing
- CSS does not block parsing
- scripts which are not async or defer block parsing -> excessive scripts can be a significant bottleneck

Optimisation: Preload scanner:
- This process occupies main thread while browser is building DOM Tree
- parse through the content available and request high priority resources like CSS, JavaScript, and web fonts.
- will retrieve resources in the background so that by the time the main HTML parser reaches requested assets, they may possibly already be in flight, or have been downloaded
- CSS fetch does not block HTML parsing but JS



% https://medium.com/jspoint/how-the-browser-renders-a-web-page-dom-cssom-and-rendering-df10531c9969
As we have learned that DOM tree generation is incremental which means as the browser reads HTML, it will add DOM elements to the DOM tree


% 2014 Hogan https://designingforperformance.com/
Chapter 2
- CRP:
- Creation of DOM Tree out of HTML



% ------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{From CSS to CSSOM}


% [CSSOM]

- DOM and CSSOM are independent data structures.

- CSSOM:
	- Characters -> Tokens -> Nodes -> CSSOM
	- Cascading rules / style sheet: Children inherit styling rules of parent
	- CSS rules cascade down
	- Partial CSS Tree not possible, because rules can be overwritten
	- Browser blocks page rendering until it receives all of the CSS
	-> CSS is render blocking

	- More specific rules are more expensive
	
	
- CSS Blocking Operation:
	- CSS blocks rendering:
	-> Rules can be overwritten, so that content can't be rendered until CSSOM is complete
	- <link rel="stylesheet" href="a.css">: Browser waits on this line, until file is received
	- Better to add styles in single file

	- JS can change styling of page -> Browser blocks JS until CSS is resolved
	
	
% https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-css



% https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/constructing-the-object-model
- CSS Stylesheet
- The CSS bytes are converted into characters, then tokens, then nodes, and finally they are linked into a tree structure known as the "CSS Object Model" (CSSOM):


% https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path
- CSSOM

% https://medium.com/@luisvieira_gmr/understanding-the-critical-rendering-path-rendering-pages-in-1-second-735c6e45b47a
- CSSOM



% https://medium.com/jspoint/how-the-browser-renders-a-web-page-dom-cssom-and-rendering-df10531c9969
- Render blocking CSS
- Unlike the DOM tree, CSSOM tree construction is not incremental and must happen in a specific manner.
- browsers can‚Äôt build the CSSOM tree incrementally as it reads the CSS content. The reason for that is, a CSS rule at the end of the file might override a CSS rule written at the top of the file
- CSS is a render-blocking resource
- Once the browser makes a request to fetch an external stylesheet, the Render Tree construction is halted.




% 2014 Hogan https://designingforperformance.com/
Chapter 2
- Request for stylesheet will block parsing -> CSS is render-blocking resource
- Creation of CSSOM


% How Browsers Work https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work
2. Building the CSSOM:
- Process CSS and build CSSOM tree
- Similar to DOM
- Usually very fast





% ------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{What happens with JavaScript}


% [JavaScript]


- JS Blocking Operation:
	- <script src=""></script>: Will be executed directly when received
	- Do i need to run JS before DOM is created?
	-> Add at end of <body>

- Async:
	- <script src="" async></script>
	- Loads script asynchronously to the page
	- DOM parsing continues
	
	
% How Browsers Work https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work
- scripts which are not async or defer block parsing -> excessive scripts can be a significant bottleneck



% How Browsers Work https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work
Other Processes:
- JavaScript Compilation: JavaScript is interpreted, compiled, parsed and executed.



% https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/adding-interactivity-with-javascript


% https://medium.com/jspoint/how-the-browser-renders-a-web-page-dom-cssom-and-rendering-df10531c9969
- Parser blocking JS
- Internal: script elements are parser-blocking. Every external file requests such as image, stylesheet, pdf, video, etc. do not block DOM construction (parsing) except script (.js) file requests.
- When the browser encounters a script element, if it an embedded script, then it will execute that script first and then continue parsing the HTML to construct the DOM tree. So all embedded scripts are parser-blocking

- External:
- If the script element is an external script file, the browser will start the download of the external script file off the main thread but it will halt the execution of the main thread until that file is downloaded. That means no more DOM parsing until the script file is downloaded
- Once the script file is downloaded, the browser will first execute the downloaded script file on the main thread (obviously) and then continue with the DOM parsing. If the browser again finds another script element in HTML, it will perform the same operation

- async:
When DOM parser encounters an external script element with async attribute, it will not halt the parsing process while the script file is being downloaded in the background. But once the file is downloaded, the parsing will halt and the script (code) will be executed.


- defer:
We also have a magical defer attribute for the script element which works similar to the async attribute but unlike the async attribute, the script doesn‚Äôt execute even when the file is fully downloaded. All defer scripts are executed once the parser has parsed all HTML which means the DOM tree is fully constructed. Unlike async scripts, all defer scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML document (or DOM tree).


All normal scripts (embedded or external) are parser-blocking as they halt the construction of DOM. All async scripts (AKA asynchronous scripts) do not block parser until they are downloaded. As soon as an async script is downloaded, it becomes parser-blocking. However, all defer scripts (AKA deferred scripts) are non-parser-blocking script as they do not block the parser and execute after the DOM tree is fully constructed.

\paragraph{Building the Render Tree}

% [Render Tree]


- Render Tree:
	- DOM + CSSOM: Content and styles
	- Only captures visible content
	- Display: none -> Children also skipped, because style cascades down
	
	
% https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-tree-construction
- The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined to form the render tree.
- Render tree contains only the nodes required to render the page.
- Layout computes the exact position and size of each object.
- The last step is paint, which takes in the final render tree and renders the pixels to the screen.

% [Conclusion, Optimizations]

% 2013 Grigorik
Chapter 10:
- Script execution can issue a synchronous doc.write and block DOM parsing and construction
- JavaScript can also block on CSS
- DOM construction cannot proceed until JavaScript is executed, and JavaScript execution cannot proceed until CSSOM is available
-> styles at the top, scripts at the bottom best practice
- Different browsers implement different logic for when, and in which order, the individual resource requests are dispatched. As a result, the performance of the application will vary from browser to browser.

- Load CSS in head
- CSS blocks rendering

- Load JS at bottom of the page
- Load Async
- JS blocks DOM construction, because browser knows that content from script tag may change Render Tree
- async tag will execute script once its ready, but order is not ber√ºcksichtigt

- DOM construction can't proceed until JavaScript is executed
- Sync script will block the DOM + rendering of your page:

- Async all the things! nice image about async attribute


- Optimizing DOM:
	- Minify HTML
	- Compression
	- Cache in Browser


- Unblocking CSS:
	- Media queries: for responsive design
	-> Move media queries to separate file
	- <link rel="stylesheet" href="style-print.css" media="print">
	-> Will not block rendering


- Optimizing JS:
	- Minify, compress, cache
	- JS is parser blocking
	- Script tag blocks DOM construction
	- For external JS, browser waits until JS is fetched and executed
	- CSS blocks rendering and JS execution

	- Load and execute script after page is loaded
	- Page is loaded: Browser fires onload event
	- Async attribute:
		- <script src="a.js" async></script>
		- Does not block CRP (DOM construction, CSSOM)

	- async attribute not applicable on inline scripts
	- Inline script blocks CSSOM unless included before CSS request


- General Strategies:
	- Minify, compress, cache (HTML, CSS, JS)

	- Minimize use of render blocking resources (CSS):
		- Media queries
		- Inline CSS

	- Minimize use of parser blocking resources (JS):
		- Defer JS execution
		- async attribute


	-> Minimize Bytes
	-> Reduce critical resources
	-> Shorten CRP length

% About measuring web performance
% Why web performance? As we saw its important for business





% https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Rum-vs-Synthetic
synthetic:
- lab environment: geography, network, device, browser, etc.
- control variables to identify performance issues. this does not reflect real world and real user experience
- automated
- simulate user paths
- traffic is generated artificial and is not by real users
 - can also be used for live system monitoring
 - fairly easy to implement, inexpensive

RUM:
- measure from real users machine
- part of page tagging (same technique with including some JS)
- measures actual use cases

\begin{center}
	\small
	\begin{longtable}{ p{0.4\linewidth} | p{0.6\linewidth} }
	Name & Description \\ 
	\hline
	Successful Tests & Amount of tests who completed successfully  \\
	
	Document Complete & The time from the initial request until the browser fires load event. Also known as the document complete time. This is the time at which the Document Object Model (DOM) has been created and all images have been downloaded and displayed. For most traditional web pages, the load time is a suitable metric for representing how long a user must wait until the page becomes usable. This is the default performance metric on WebPageTest. Also known as Load Time (?). Around this time, the page's script is hard at work in the load-event handler firing off more requests for secondary content. The incomplete nature of this metric is why Fully Loaded was added to the table of metrics from the previous section. window.onload (?). The point where the browser onLoad event fires. The equivalent Navigation Timing event is loadEventStart. Document Complete Time: Amount of time that has elapsed from the initial page request until the browser fires the load event. This is the time at which the Document Object Model (DOM) has been created and all images have been downloaded and displayed. \\
	
	Fully Loaded & The time from the initial request until WebPageTest determines that the page has finished loading content. The page might have waited for the load event to defer loading secondary content. The time it takes to load the secondary content is accounted for in the Fully Loaded Time. The time (in ms) the page took to be fully loaded ‚Äî e.g., 2 seconds of no network activity after Document Complete. This will usually include any activity that is triggered by javascript after the main page loads. The point after onLoad where network activity has stopped for 2 seconds. Specific to WebPageTest and not provided by Performance API. Fully loaded waits for 2 seconds of no network activity (and no outstanding requests) after onLoad and then calls it done (only measures to the last activity, doesn't include the 2 seconds of silence in the measurement). Fully Loaded is a measure based on the network activity and is the point after onload when there was no activity for 2 seconds. \\
	
	First Byte & Time until the server responds with the first byte of the response.  \\
	
	Start Render & Time until the browser paints content to the screen. The time for the browser to display the first pixel of content (paint) on the screen. Time until the browser paints content to the screen. WebPageTest's own metric, determined by programmatically watching for visual changes to the page. Same as First Render? \\
	
	Bytes In (Doc) & Total size of the Document Complete Requests' response bodies in bytes.  \\
	
	Requests (Doc) & Number of HTTP requests before the load event, not including the initial request. \\
	
	Load Event Start & Time in ms since navigation started until window.onload event was triggered (from W3C Navigation Timing). \\
	
	Speed Index	& See Speed Index  \\
	
	Last Visual Change & Time in ms until the last visual changed occured. Last change is a completely visual measurement and is the last point in the test when something visually changed on the screen. It could be something as simple as an animated gif or ad even that didn't really cause much CPU work but changed some pixels on the screen. It is only captured when video is recorded because it depends on the video capture to measure it. \\
	
	Visually Complete & Time in ms when page was visually completed. Is measured from a video capture of the viewport loading and is the point when the visible part of the page first reached 100\% "completeness" compared to the end state of the test. \\

	Page Load Sample & The number of pageviews that were sampled to calculate the average page-load time.  \\
	
	Speed Metrics Sample & The sample set (or count) of pageviews used to calculate the averages of site speed metrics. This metric is used in all site speed average calculations, including avgDomainLookupTime, avgPageDownloadTime, avgRedirectionTime, avgServerConnectionTime, and avgServerResponseTime.  \\
	
	DOM Latency Metrics Sample & Sample set (or count) of pageviews used to calculate the averages for site speed DOM metrics. This metric is used to calculate ga:avgDomContentLoadedTime and ga:avgDomInteractiveTime.  \\

	Page Load Time (sec) & The average amount of time (in seconds) it takes that page to load, from initiation of the pageview (e.g., click on a page link) to load completion in the browser.  \\
	
	Domain Lookup Time (sec) & The average amount of time spent in DNS lookup for the page.  \\
	
	Page Download Time (sec) & The time to download your page.  \\
	
	Redirection Time (sec) & The time spent in redirection before fetching the page. If there are no redirects, the value for this metric is expected to be 0.  \\
	
	Server Connection Time (sec) & The time needed for the user to connect to your server.  \\

	Server Response Time (sec) & The time for your server to respond to a user request, including the network time from the user's location to your server.  \\
	
	Document Interactive Time (sec) & The average time (in seconds) that the browser takes to parse the document (DOMInteractive), including the network time from the user's location to your server. At this time, the user can interact with the Document Object Model even though it is not fully loaded.  \\

	Document Content Loaded Time (sec) & The average time (in seconds) that the browser takes to parse the document and execute deferred and parser-inserted scripts (DOMContentLoaded), including the network time from the user's location to your server. Parsing of the document is finished, the Document Object Model is ready, but referenced style sheets, images, and subframes may not be finished loading. This event is often the starting point for javascript framework execution, e.g., JQuery's onready() callback, etc.  \\

\begin{itemize}
\item We can show this with experiments
\item Load test page on a specific day only once and save timings exposed by performance.timing object (from console)
\item Calculate differences corresponding to the table
\item Get GA data for that day and save it
